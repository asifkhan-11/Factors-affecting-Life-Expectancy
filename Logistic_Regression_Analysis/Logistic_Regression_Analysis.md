#Logistic Regression Analysis

##As the main question for our project is derive the Life Expectancy of people in different Countries based on different independent variables. Logistic Regression is a classification technique in which require set of class as 0 or 1 for the values of the dependent variable.
##As our dataset is on detecting the factors affecting the life expectancy of a person, it depends on the Life Expectancy as a dependent variable and class of the variable is numeric is nature.
##Therefore, we cannot apply logistic regression to our specific model as the values associated with logistic regression for the dependent variable should lie between 0 to 1.

 
##When we run the logistic regression, we get this result in our case as Error. As the values associated with the dependent variable (Life.expectancy) does not belong to 0 or 1 class.
##Therefore, we cannot apply logistic regression technique to our analysis.
